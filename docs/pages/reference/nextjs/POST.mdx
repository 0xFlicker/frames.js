# POST

A function ready made for next.js in order to directly export it, which handles all incoming `POST` requests that apps will trigger when users press buttons in your Frame.
It handles all the redirecting for you, correctly, based on the `FrameContainer` props defined by the Frame that triggered the user action.
@param req a `NextRequest` object from `next/server` (Next.js app router server components)
@returns NextResponse

## Usage

```ts [./app/frames/route.ts]

export { POST } from "frames.js/next/server";
```
